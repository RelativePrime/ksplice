behaving differently from the compiler and assembler used to build the running

=head1 NAME

ksplice-apply - Apply an on-disk Ksplice update to the running kernel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ksplice-apply> I<UPDATE_TARBALL>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ksplice-apply> takes as input a Ksplice update tarball, as generated by
L<ksplice-create(8)>, and it applies the update to the running binary kernel.

Specifically, B<ksplice-apply> does the following:

=over

=item 1.

Inserts the "primary" module into the kernel.

=item 2.

Inserts the "helper" module into the kernel (doing so applies the
update).

=item 3.

Removes the "helper" module from the kernel (that module is not needed
after the update has been applied).

=back

The update tarball used with B<ksplice-apply> must have been generated for the
running kernel's version.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--debug=>I<DEBUG_LEVEL>

Applies the update with debugging output enabled.  Recommended only for
debugging.  I<DEBUG_LEVEL> should be an integer between 0 and 4.  B<--debug=4>
provides the most debugging information.

=over

=item Z<> B<0>

No debugging output.

=item Z<> B<1>

Provides basic (pre-run matching and kernel stack check) debugging output.

=item Z<> B<2>

Also provides full kernel stack check debugging output.

=item Z<> B<3>

Also provides full pre-run matching debugging output.

=item Z<> B<4>

Also provides full Ksplice relocation debugging output.
