Ksplice has aborted the undo operation because it appears that the code that
you are trying to change is continuously in use by the system.  More
specifically, Ksplice has been unable to find a moment when one or more of the
to-be-changed functions is not on a thread's kernel stack.

=head1 NAME

ksplice-undo - Undo a Ksplice update that has been applied to the running kernel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ksplice-undo> I<KSPLICE_ID>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ksplice-undo> takes as input a Ksplice identification tag, as reported by
L<ksplice-view(8)>, and it reverses that update within the running binary kernel.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--debug>

Reverses the update with debugging output enabled.  Recommended only for
debugging.  I<DEBUG_LEVEL> should be an integer between 0 and 2.  B<--debug=2>
provides the most debugging information.

=over

=item Z<> B<0>

No debugging output.

=item Z<> B<1>

Provides basic kernel stack check debugging output.

=item Z<> B<2>

Provides full kernel stack check debugging output.
